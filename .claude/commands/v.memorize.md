# v.memorize — Session Consolidation
**Purpose**: Summarize this session into persistent docs and keep live files slim.

## Steps
1. Update ai/memory/progress.md: state, next steps, recent decisions, blockers.
2. Update CHANGELOG.md (if tasks completed).
3. If progress.md or plan.md is large, move details to ai/memory/archive/ and leave pointers.
4. Only update CLAUDE.md / techenv.md if rules or environment changed (avoid bloat).

## Result
- Progress and changelog updated.
- Archives rotated as needed.
- Ready to clear conversation.

## Notes
- Use v.initmemory to merge or reconcile old archives.
